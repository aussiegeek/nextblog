Have you looked at the [@apollo/client/testing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/) package, but were unsatisfied with the limited range of testing it allows? How do you test error or loading conditions?

My solution to that is to use the fantastic mocking tools from [graphql-tools](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/mocking/) that allow a full GraphQL schema to be mocked, and allows us to override resolvers easily.

For today‚Äôs example I‚Äôm using to use the example GraphQL endpoint at [graphqlcountries.com](https://graphqlcountries.com)

## Setup

First, you‚Äôll need to install a few npm packages

`npm install --save-dev @graphql-tools/mock @graphql-tools/schema apollo`

Next we need to fetch the schema for our GraphQL endpoint. This because `@graphql-tools/mock` will help us generate mock data that matches our schema unless we override this data (which we will in some places to make our tests work predictably)

There are a number of ways of getting this GraphQL schema file, depending on the backend you use, but if your GraphQL endpoint supports introspection, then we can use the `apollo` command line tool we installed above to fetch it for us.

You will need to configure it by creating a `apollo.config.js` file in the root of your repository, with the following content

```
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: { name: "graphqlcountries", url: "https://graphqlcountries.com" },
  },
};
```

Last of all, add a script task to your `package.json` called `schema:download` and set the task to `apollo client:download-schema schema.graphql`, and then run `npm run client:download-schema`, which will have created a `schema.graphql` in the root of your repository. (This could also create introspection JSON, but I use the AST format as its human readable, and refer to it often)

## To the tests

For our tests we are going to use React Testing Library, and check for the paths our code could take. First of all lets build a barebones test that we will know will fail.

```
import React from "react";
import { Country } from "./Country";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";

describe("Country component", () => {
  test("show country name & flag", async () => {
    render(<Country />);
    expect(await screen.findByText("Australia")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(await screen.findByText("üá¶üá∫")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

Running this test fails, with the error `Could not find "client" in the context or passed in as an option. Wrap the root component in an <ApolloProvider>, or pass an ApolloClient instance in via options.`

Right here is where we previously would have reached for @apollo/client/testing, but instead we are going to make our own real ApolloClient. There are a couple of steps here, but they can be extracted out to a shared module

We need to import a few more packages to get a mock schema up and running

```
import { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";
import { SchemaLink } from "@apollo/client/link/schema";
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { addMocksToSchema } from "@graphql-tools/mock";
import * as fs from "fs";
```

Next, we are going to create a component that wraps our Country component that can be used in each test

```
// load GraphQL schema from disk
const typeDefs = fs.readFileSync("schema.graphql", "utf-8");

const WrappedCountry = () => {
  // turn schema string in to a real schema that can be queried against
  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs });

  // add mocks to the schema to return the data we expect
  const schemaWithMocks = addMocksToSchema({ schema });
  // create an Apollo client that uses our mock schema
  const client = new ApolloClient({
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    link: new SchemaLink({ schema: schemaWithMocks }),
  });
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <Country />
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
};
```

Now we can update the `render` function at the start of our test to use the `WrappedCountry` component instead, and run our tests again.

We are met with `TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Australia`, which is great news, our tests ran far enough to render the component, and for the component to then query GraphQL, but what did it return?

Looking at the error the render function some more, we see some suspicious ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù strings in the rendered HTML

```
<dl>‚Äá
  <dt>Country</dt>‚Äá
  <dd>Hello World</dd>‚Äá

  <dt>Flag</dt>
  <dd>Hello World</dd>‚Äá
</dl>
```

The Hello World is coming from @graphql-tools/mock, unless it is told otherwise it will use ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù for any field that should return a String. However, to be useful for us, we want to create our own mock for the `Country` object returned from GraphQL.

Back in our `WrappedCountry` component, add an object that generates a more consistent mock, and update our `schemaWithMocks` object to one that returns out mocks

```
const mocks = {
  Country: () => {
    return {
      name: "Australia",
      emoji: "üá¶üá∫",
    };
  },
};
const schemaWithMocks = addMocksToSchema({
  schema,
  mocks,
});
```

And with that, we now have our first passing test.

At this point, we have added a chunk of code for our tests, but haven‚Äôt reaped the reward of these changes, so lets run through some more quite reasonable scenarios

## Custom Resolvers

To test other scenarios we need to be able to modify what happens in the `country` resolver, so next are changes to allow us to use custom revolvers.

```
const WrappedCountry = ({
  resolvers,
}: {
  resolvers?: IExecutableSchemaDefinition["resolvers"];
}) => {
  // added the resolvers param to allow our custom resolver
  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs: schemaString, resolvers });
  const mocks = {
    Country: () => {
      return {
        name: "Australia",
        emoji: "üá¶üá∫",
      };
    },
  };
  // preserveResolvers is requried to keep our custom resolver in the mocked schema
  const schemaWithMocks = addMocksToSchema({
    schema,
    mocks,
    preserveResolvers: true,
  });

  const client = new ApolloClient({
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    link: new SchemaLink({ schema: schemaWithMocks }),
  });
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <Country />
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
};
```

## Field returns null

In our `Country` component we use data in the `data.country` object returned from Apollo. What if this field returns null? Here we just set the resolver to always return null

```
  test("not found", async () => {
    const country = () => null;
    render(<WrappedCountry resolvers={{ Query: { country } }} />);
    expect(await screen.findByText("Not found")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
```

## Loading

The key for Apollo to return `true` for the loading variable is to render the component before the resolver returns, so this time we will return a promise that takes 2 seconds to resolve

````
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
  test("loading", async () => {
    const wait = (ms: number) =>
      new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

    const country = async () => {
      await wait(2000);
      return mockValidCountry;
    };
    render(<WrappedCountry resolvers={{ Query: { country } }} />);
    expect(await screen.findByText("Loading")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
````

## Error

Lastly, this brings me to the scenario I had a number of missteps working out how to test for. What if there is a server side error?

```
  test("errors", async () => {
    const country = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
      return new GraphQLError("Test error");
    });
    render(<WrappedCountry resolvers={{ Query: { country } }} />);
    expect(await screen.findByText(/Error/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
```

The key here is to use a `GraphQLError` otherwise the Apollo schema link will catch the error.

I hope this helps you test the ways your Apollo component can deviate off of the happy path. I haven‚Äôt covered testing mutations today, which have a few more working parts, but that is coming soon.
