I’m not a designer but over time I’ve collected some guidelines for some simple improvements of look and feel

1. Make things line up with each other
2. Make things consistent with the other things
3. Give it more padding! Seriously, try giving it too much and working back, you'll be amazed
4. Make sure there is constrast. Sure that text might be readable on your awesome screen in your office with sensible light, but what about on a terrible monitor, or in direct sun on a phone in the middle of the day?
5. If a choice is binary (ie. only two options to pick from, a checkbox is probably what you are looking for)
6. If there is a small collection of choices (no more than about 5), a radio button is the way to go (if there is more, use a select box)
