Have you ever been in the situation where you need to have state stored in component, and be able to access it in a child component, or a sibling component?

This isnâ€™t at all unusual, and there are a wide range of answers to how to handle this, but in simple cases, we can keep things simple.

Imagine you have a value stored in state, a button to increment it, and a `<div>` to display it in

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment counter</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

All straight forward, but what do you actually do when the span to show the count is in one component, and the button to increment it is in another?

The key is in the name of the concept: _lifting state_

In this next example, we have three components: `Parent`, `CountChild` and `ButtonChild`. The code to show the count has been moved to the `CountChild`, and the code for the button to is in the `ButtonChild`. We setup the `useState` hook in the parent exactly the same as we have done previously, pass the `count` variable as a prop to `CountChild` for it to display all as per normal.

The key is passing a reference to `setCount` to the `ButtonChild` that allows it to update the state that is shared

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <CountChild count={count} />
      <ButtonChild count={count} setCount={setCount} />
    </div>
  );
}

function CountChild({ count }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>CountChild</h2>
      <div>Current Count: {count}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function ButtonChild({ count, setCount }) {
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>ButtonChild</h2>
      <div>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment counter</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
